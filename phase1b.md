## Software Delivery Cycle
Steps that show where a project goes through the life of the project. It starts with
the Requirements and the planning required the software gets designed and developed
and gets tested and ready for deployment.

## Test Driven Development
You would essentially undewrstand the task given to you. You would design a test
that would satisfy the criteria and then check the test fail condition. A working
solution will be created and then the pass condition would be tested. If everything
passes then the code is complete and you would get a new task.

## Continuous Integration
The project is broken into parks and each team works on one part. Each team will
update the master branch multiple times a day and when two parts don't interact as well,
the issue will be identified and can be fixed.

## Continuous Delivery
The team is always releasing software and its slowly improving. You have something
to show to investors all the time.

## Configuration Management
Configuration management is a process for maintaining computer systems, 
servers, and software in a desired, consistent state. 
It’s a way to make sure that a system performs as it’s 
expected to as changes are made over time. 


## Containerization
A container is essentially a fully packaged and portable computing environment.
It's essentially like a lightweight VM in the cloud.

## Cloud Scalability, and Reliability
Cloud scalability in cloud computing refers to the ability to 
increase or decrease IT resources as needed to meet changing demand. 
Scalability is one of the hallmarks of the cloud and the primary driver 
of its exploding popularity with businesses.
